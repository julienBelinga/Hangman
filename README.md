# Hangman Game in LOLCODE üìù  
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game written in LOLCODE, a programming language created to resemble the "LOLCAT" Internet meme. The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn until the stick figure is complete and the game is lost.

This project was created as an exercise to try out LOLCODE and to have a bit of fun with the language. Although LOLCODE is not a practical language for most programming tasks, it can be a great way to learn about programming concepts in a humorous and engaging way.  

## Instructions üìö
To play the game, simply run the hangman.lol file using a LOLCODE interpreter. You will be prompted to enter a word to be guessed by the player. Once the word is entered, the player will be given a set number of guesses to try and guess the word by entering one letter at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of the stick figure is drawn until the figure is complete and the game is lost.

## Launch the project üöÄ  
- Install a LOLCODE interpreter on your computer. You can find a list of interpreters and installation instructions on the LOLCODE website (http://www.lolcode.org/).
- Download or clone the project files from the repository.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
- Run the hangman.lol file using the LOLCODE interpreter. For example, if you are using the lci interpreter on a Unix-based system, you can run the command:
```lci hangman.lol```
- Follow the instructions in the game to play Hangman!
    
## Joke üòÇ
It's time for you to take a shower and go to bed, but don't worry - the game won't take long! In fact, it might be over before you know it. But don't worry, you can always play again and try to beat your high score!

## Future Improvements ‚ú®  
Here are some ideas for improving the game in the future:

- Add a way to choose the difficulty level of the game, such as by allowing the player to choose the length of the word or the number of guesses allowed.
- Implement a way to save and load games, so players can come back to a game they didn't finish.
- Add a graphical interface to make the game more visually appealing.
- Allow for multiplayer games, so players can compete against each other.
- Add a feature that allows players to enter their own categories and words to guess.

Overall, this project was a fun and educational way to explore LOLCODE and programming concepts. We hope you enjoy playing the game and learning more about programming in the process!
